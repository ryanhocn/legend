# Legend case backlog

Case seeds for `CASE_AUTHORING.md`. Each seed is a condition plus the reasoning failure it
punishes (the spine) plus the safety catch that becomes a `critical` rubric item. Tick and
delete a seed once its case exists.

**Difficulty gradient (the main design rule).** Most intern/FY cases should be routine: a
stable ward patient where the task is to type up a clean, complete, structured progress
note. The skill tested is safe documentation, and the catch is a mundane omission (VTE
prophylaxis not charted, an antibiotic with no stop date, a result nobody chased, a drip
that should be stopped). Save the spiky anchoring traps, the can't-miss diagnoses, and the
ownership/ceiling calls for reg and PGY3+ cases with a higher `minGrade`. This matches the
engine: the patient list sorts easiest-first, and signing a case above your grade scores
-1000. Even a vanilla case still needs one safety catch (contract minimum): a note with
nothing to catch is typing practice, not a case.

**Inventing new cases.** Watch real practice and lift the failure. Examples worth turning
into cases: an ENT patient discharged on the wrong antibiotic and recalled to hospital
(author the discharge note with the error left in and have the trainee spot it); or a
reflexive "amoxicillin + gentamicin + metronidazole for two weeks for everything" that
ignores the gram stain and the culture. Those are idea generators, not committed entries.

FY cases are day-2 progress notes; the problem is already in the chart. Build a couple
first and validate the pipeline (`tsc -b`, `npm test`, leaky-trigger check); the rubric is
the hard part. `cholangitis001` (anchoring) is the reference case and is not listed.

## Deliberately excluded (and why)

- Pure Year 1 basic science (glycolysis, Nernst equation, embryology mechanisms): no patient or chart to reason over.
- Screening/epidemiology knowledge (breast screening, incidence vs prevalence): tests recall, not chart interpretation.
- `cholangitis001`: already the reference implementation.
