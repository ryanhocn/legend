# Authoring a Legend case

This is the contract for adding a training case, written for both humans and
coding agents (Cowork). A case is one folder under `src/data/patients/<caseId>/`
plus one entry in `src/data/patients/index.ts`. Nothing else in the app changes.
`cholangitis001` is the reference implementation: when this document and that
folder disagree, the folder wins, and this document should be fixed.

The gate is mechanical: a case that passes the checklist at the bottom is
integrated; one that does not is not. `npx tsc -b` enforces every shape below.

## What makes a good case (clinical design)

- **One teaching spine.** A case exists to punish a specific reasoning failure
  (cholangitis001 punishes anchoring: epigastric pain that looks like
  dyspepsia). Decide the failure first, then build the chart around it.
- **One safety catch minimum.** Something in the chart that a careless note
  misses at the patient's expense (allergy vs prescription, a held med, a
  pending result nobody chased). These become `critical` rubric items.
- **Atypical but realistic.** The presentation should be off-pattern enough
  that pattern-matching fails, without becoming a zebra.
- **Everything synthetic.** Invented names, no real patients or clinicians,
  MRN in the `LEG-0000NN` series (unique across the registry). Keep the
  disclaimer sentence in report bodies where the existing case has it.
  (Sanctioned exception: `test001` under the "TestList" specialty is a
  non-clinical utility patient for persistence/permissions testing; it uses
  the `LEG-T000NN` MRN range and a deliberately tiny rubric. The clinical
  rules in this document do not apply to it, and it must never be cited as
  a template for real cases.) Disclaimer text:
  "All patient data are synthetic. For education and simulation only. Not for
  clinical use."

## Folder layout

```
src/data/patients/<caseId>/
  patient.json     demographics, care team, allergies, sticky-note seed
  summary.ts       exports one CaseSummary object
  bloods.ts        exports bloods: BloodRow[]
  documents.ts     exports the ClinicalDocument[] and its kind:"note" subset
  encounters.ts    exports the Encounter[] timeline
  rubric.ts        exports the CaseRubric (items + model note)
  rubric.test.ts   vitest content tests (required, see below)
```

`<caseId>` is condition plus a three-digit serial, lowercase: `cholangitis001`.
Export names are prefixed with the case, e.g. `caseAppendicitis001Documents`.

## Type contracts

All shapes live in `src/types.ts` and are checked by `tsc`. The registry entry
is a `CaseBundle`; read that type first. Key fields with non-obvious rules:

- **`patient.json`** must match `CasePatient` exactly. `mrn` is the display
  MRN (`LEG-0000NN`); the folder name is the case id. `stickyNote` seeds the
  trainee's scratchpad: write it as terse revision pointers that hint at the
  teaching spine without solving it outright.
- **Documents** (`ClinicalDocument`, discriminated on `kind`):
  - Every document carries an `encounterId` pointing at a row in
    `encounters.ts`. An encounter row resolves its primary document by that
    link, preferring a non-note document over a note.
  - `kind:"note"` documents carry `timestamp` (Unix epoch **seconds**), the
    Notes list sort key. Display strings (`dateOfService`, `fileTime`) are
    separate hand-written fields; keep them consistent with the timestamp.
  - Report kinds (`letter`/`report`/`order`/`encounterSummary`) and the
    structured `lab`/`micro` kinds have **no** timestamp; they are reached
    through their encounter row.
  - The admission bloods receipt must be **generated from `bloods.ts`**, not
    retyped (see how cholangitis001 `documents.ts` maps `bloods` into
    `LabRow[]`). One source, no drift.
- **Doctor IDs and the player persona**:
  - Staff can carry a synthetic doctor ID (`d` + 6 digits, ranges d0-d8; d9 is
    reserved for runtime-generated logins). Give a note an `authorId` to make it
    attributable to a person. To let the trainee play a specific clinician in a
    case (their notes become addendable as "yours"), set that clinician's ID as
    `playerHcpId` on the case's registry entry in `src/data/patients/index.ts`.
    Notes without an `authorId` are ownable by nobody. Example: cholangitis001
    sets `playerHcpId: "d284617"` (Mensah, Daniel) and stamps his four notes.
- **`anchor`** (optional, on the registry `CaseBundle` entry): Unix epoch
  **seconds** for the case's "present" (the admission moment). When set,
  trainee notes are stamped from it via `lib/simTime.ts`'s `caseNow`, and all
  display formatting in that module renders in UTC. Only cholangitis001 sets
  one so far; cases without an `anchor` fall back to the real wall clock.
- **Encounters** (`Encounter[]`):
  - Array order IS the timeline display order, newest first. The recency
    `group` headers ("2 Weeks Ago") are hand-tuned per row, not computed.
  - `date` is DD/MM/YYYY, never a relative label. `class` drives the filter
    bar (`inpatient` | `outpatient` | `ed`); set `admission: true` only on
    the admission event itself.
- **`summary.ts`** is one `CaseSummary` object: the Summary dashboard
  (vitals trend, problems, meds, weights, micro one-liners). Vitals should
  tell the same story as the notes (a septic patient trends septic).

## Rubric authoring (the hard part)

The rubric is what turns a chart into feedback; budget more review time here
than for the chart itself.

- Aim for 12 to 15 items across the four categories: `safety`, `findings`,
  `assessment`, `plan`. Mark genuine patient-harm omissions `critical`.
- Trigger semantics (`RubricTrigger = string[][]`): an item matches if ANY
  trigger matches; a trigger matches if EVERY group in it has a hit; a group
  hits if ANY of its synonym phrases appears. Matching is lowercase,
  punctuation-stripped, with one-typo tolerance on words of 5+ letters.
  Example: `[["bilirubin"], ["raised", "elevated", "high"]]` requires
  bilirubin plus any qualifier.
- Author triggers against the actual chart wording and your model note, not
  from imagination. Synonyms should cover how a student would phrase it, not
  every English paraphrase (a Claude judge for paraphrase-heavy items is a
  separate roadmap stage).
- `wordBand` sets the conciseness band for the note type; the model note must
  sit inside it. `sections` lists expected section headers (OR within a
  group): these score "organized".
- `modelNote` is a consultant-standard plain-text note, revealed only after
  scoring. It must hit every rubric item: that is tested, not aspirational.
- **Task & hierarchy** (rubric.ts `task`): every case declares the note task it
  expects — `code` (`progress` | `ward` | `ptwr` | `ed`), a display `label`
  (e.g. "POST-TAKE WARD ROUND"), and `minGrade` (`fy` | `st3` | `consultant`).
  The patient list shows it and sorts easiest-first; signing a case above your
  grade scores -1000 (overreach). Authoring targets: FY-level cases are
  hospital-day-2+ progress-note scenarios (`code: "progress"`, `minGrade: "fy"`)
  whose twist is recognizable and escalatable by a junior — size the rubric
  `wordBand` generously, since the PROGRESS SmartText embeds vitals and labs
  (~60-100 words). Consultant-level cases (`minGrade: "consultant"`) hinge on
  judgment and ownership: complex multi-problem post-takes, ceiling-of-care and
  end-of-life decisions, major post-intervention complications, cross-specialty
  conflict.
- **Trigger hygiene (enforced by the build)**: the PROGRESS SmartText embeds the
  case's real vitals line and every `bloods.ts` row (values, ranges, and flags
  like "High", "Low", "High (mild)") into the note body. No rubric trigger may
  be satisfiable by that pasted data alone — points are for interpretation, not
  transcription. Never pair a test name with only its raw value or flag words
  (`[["creatinine"], ["148"]]` leaks); require an interpretive token the
  template cannot emit (`"baseline"`, `"rising"`, `"persistent"`, a diagnosis
  word). Matching is note-global, so a word in ANY lab row's flag can combine
  with a test name elsewhere. `src/data/patients/progress-autofill.test.ts`
  runs this check against every registered case — `npm test` fails on a leaky
  rubric.
- **`rubric.test.ts` is required** and must at minimum mirror
  `cholangitis001/rubric.test.ts`:
  1. the model note matches every item (no misses, no critical misses),
  2. the model note is inside its own word band,
  3. the model note contains every expected section,
  4. a deliberately dangerous note trips each critical item,
  5. every item has a label, explanation, at least one trigger, and PDQI tags.

## Registry hookup

Add one entry to `src/data/patients/index.ts`:

- `id`: the folder name.
- `specialty`: the patient-list grouping (admitting service, e.g. "General
  Surgery", "Emergency Medicine"). New specialty strings create new lists
  automatically.
- `handoff`: one line for the patient-list row, in handover voice:
  "64F, epigastric pain + rigors + new jaundice. ?Acute cholangitis (TG18 II),
  for urgent ERCP."

## Dynamic events (optional, `events.ts` + `rounds` + `chronos`)

A case may opt into runtime reveals on top of its static chart: a result appearing later,
an encounter row being added, a vitals trend advancing, an NPC ward-round note filed by
the rest of the team, a Chronos time-skip channel. This is optional and additive: a case
with no `events.ts` behaves exactly as it does today (the reveal filter over an empty list
is a no-op). `cholangitis001` (`src/data/patients/cholangitis001/events.ts`) is the worked
reference; when this document and that file disagree, the file wins.

A dynamic case's `events.ts` exports three arrays, all optional but authored together:

- **`events: AuthoredEvent[]`** (type in `src/types.ts`). Each entry is
  `{ at, seq, dedupeKey?, event }`:
  - `at`: a sim-offset in **seconds** from the case's `anchor`, not a wall-clock time and
    not a static document `timestamp`. The engine compares `at` against the per-case
    `simNow` clock, never a display string.
  - `seq`: total fold order across the case's authored events; keep it monotonic with `at`
    (on an `at` tie, an `encounter.append` must precede the `result.release` or
    `note.create` that lands on it, so the row exists when the receipt/note folds).
  - `dedupeKey` (optional): a handle for later suppression/dedupe.
  - `event`: a `CaseEvent` reveal, one of `note.create` / `note.addendum` /
    `result.release` / `encounter.append` / `vitals.append` / `flag.set`.
  - **Any round or result that should show up in the Encounters timeline must also author
    an `encounter.append`** for it. `result.release` and `note.create` do not create their
    own encounter row; if a chart reveal needs one, author it as a separate event with the
    same `at`, sequenced first.
- **`rounds: RoundSpec[]`**: the case's action-keyed morning-round schedule (`{ at,
  encounterId, label, npcNoteId? }`). Round 0 is normally the trainee's rubric-scored task
  and reuses the static `enc-admission` encounter; later rounds get their own
  `encounterId` so a trainee note written at that round suppresses the round's NPC note.
  Signing a fresh round note advances the clock to `nextRoundAt`.
- **`chronos: ChronosIntent[]`**: deterministic time-skip intents (`{ triggers, targetAt,
  reply }`), matched with the same rubric-trigger engine as rubric items (`RubricTrigger`
  groups, no LLM). A matched intent advances `simNow` straight to `targetAt`, which lets
  intervening rounds' NPC notes materialise on catch-up.
  - **Caution:** if a `reply` names a specific datum (the organism, its sensitivities, a
    result value), that text must be kept in sync BY HAND with the authored reveal payload
    it describes (e.g. a `ClinicalMicro.organisms[].sensitivities` entry). There is no CI
    check that the two agree; a drifted `reply` will quietly tell the trainee something the
    chart does not show.

**FLAG 1 (anchor vs static epochs):** cholangitis001's *static*, pre-authored note
`timestamp` epochs sit roughly 24-33 hours BEHIND the case's `anchor` (the static notes
were filed the day before the admission moment the anchor marks). Every `events.ts` `at`
offset is measured from the **anchor**, never from those static epochs; do not eyeball "N
hours after the last static note" when authoring a reveal `at`, compute it from the anchor.

**NPC-note leak safety (mandatory, CI-enforced):** an authored NPC ward-round note (a
`note.create` your `rounds[].npcNoteId` names) must score **ZERO** against the case's
rubric: it exists to make the chart feel alive between trainee-written rounds, not to hand
the trainee any rubric answer. Two automated checks enforce this and both must pass:
- `src/data/patients/progress-autofill.test.ts` (the existing PROGRESS SmartText leak
  guard) is extended to score every registered case's authored NPC note bodies against
  that case's own rubric and assert zero matches, alongside its per-reachable-dynamic-state
  sweep (folds `applyEvents(revealEvents(...))` at every `at`/`round.at`/`chronos.targetAt`
  the case can reach and re-runs the autofill leak check at each one).
- `<caseId>/events.walker.test.ts` (per dynamic case) replays the authored timeline
  end-to-end: `seq` stays monotonic with `at`, every event is reachable, no `note.create`
  or `result.release` references a dangling `encounterId`, reveals are a monotonic prefix
  as `simNow` advances, NPC suppression fires once the round's encounter is covered, and
  every chronos `targetAt` names a real authored `at`.

**NPC notes reveal at the FOLLOWING round's `at`**, not their own dated timestamp: an NPC
note is DATED the day it was notionally written (its `timestamp` field, for display) but
only becomes visible once the trainee has moved past the round it covers, i.e. at the next
round's `at`. This is what lets a trainee who skips writing a round see the team's note
instead of a gap, while a trainee who writes that round's note suppresses the NPC one
entirely (`revealEvents`'s `coveredEncounterIds`, keyed on `RoundSpec.encounterId`).

Wire-up: import `events`/`rounds`/`chronos` in `src/data/patients/index.ts` and set the
matching keys on the case's registry entry (all three are optional; a case can opt into
just one, e.g. `events` with no `rounds`/`chronos`). A case needs an `anchor` for its
`events.ts` `at` offsets to have a fixed origin; don't author `events.ts` against a case
with no `anchor`.

## Acceptance checklist

Run all of these; every one must pass before the case is done.

```bash
npx tsc -b        # shapes match; no missing fields
npm test          # includes your rubric.test.ts
npm run lint      # clean baseline; add nothing
npm run dev
```

Then in the browser:

1. The case appears in Patient Lists under its specialty; the row opens it.
2. Every encounter row opens a document; labs and micro render as receipts.
3. The Notes list is ordered newest-first and every note body renders.
4. Write a note from the model note, Sign it, and confirm the Performance
   dock scores at or near full marks; write a careless note and confirm the
   critical catches fire as unsafe omissions.
5. Sign out and confirm the case resets cleanly.
