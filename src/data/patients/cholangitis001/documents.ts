    body: `GENERAL SURGERY ADMISSION H&P
Admission Date: Today — PCP: Shah, Rajesh, MD

CC: Central epigastric pain, rigors and new jaundice.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Amelia Hart is a 64-year-old woman presenting with ~5 days of constant CENTRAL
EPIGASTRIC pain radiating to the back, worse after meals. She was seen by her GP
2 weeks ago and started on omeprazole for presumed dyspepsia, with little relief.
Overnight she developed rigors (shaking chills), passed dark urine, and her family
noticed scleral icterus. She denies prior biliary surgery.

Of note, the pain is MIDLINE rather than right upper quadrant, which initially
pointed away from a biliary cause. She has known gallstones (US 01/2026, then
asymptomatic). Since being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in 01/2026 she has lost
~10 kg (84 -> 74 kg, ~12% body weight) on metformin and a low-calorie diet —
rapid weight loss being a recognised driver of new cholesterol gallstones.

In the Emergency Department she was febrile (38.6), tachycardic (HR 112) and
borderline hypotensive (BP 102/64), with a positive sepsis screen.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Gallstones (US 01/2026)                         16/01/2026
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus (metformin)            13/01/2026
- Hyperlipidaemia                                 2019
- Essential hypertension                          2019

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
- Nil of note.

ALLERGIES:
- Penicillin — rash.

MEDICATIONS (on admission):
- Metformin 500 mg PO BD
- Atorvastatin 40 mg PO ON
- Amlodipine 5 mg PO OD
- Omeprazole 20 mg PO OD (started 05/06/2026 for "dyspepsia")

EXAMINATION:
- Alert, mildly jaundiced, warm peripheries.
- Abdomen: soft; tenderness is EPIGASTRIC > RUQ. Murphy's sign NEGATIVE. No
  peritonism, no palpable mass.
- Chest clear, heart sounds normal.

INVESTIGATIONS:
- WCC 17.4, CRP 214, bilirubin 96, ALP 402, GGT 388, ALT 128, lactate 2.6.
- Lipase only mildly raised (92) — against primary acute pancreatitis.
- ECG sinus tachycardia, troponin not raised (epigastric pain — ACS excluded).
- US abdomen: dilated CBD 10 mm with obstructing distal stone; gallbladder calculi.

IMPRESSION:
Acute cholangitis secondary to choledocholithiasis, with sepsis physiology.
Diagnosis by Tokyo Guidelines (TG18): systemic inflammation (fever, raised
WCC/CRP) + cholestasis (jaundice, obstructive LFTs) + imaging (CBD dilatation +
stone) = DEFINITE acute cholangitis. Severity TG18 Grade II (moderate). The
incomplete Charcot triad on arrival illustrates its limited sensitivity.

PLAN:
1. Sepsis six. Blood + urine cultures sent BEFORE antibiotics; IV crystalloid
   resuscitation; hourly urine output.
2. Antibiotics: broad-spectrum piperacillin/tazobactam started promptly in ED
   on the sepsis pathway. Penicillin allergy identified at ward medicines
   reconciliation — switch to ciprofloxacin + metronidazole (see microbiology).
3. Urgent ERCP today for biliary decompression — gastroenterology referral.
4. NBM pending ERCP. Metformin was continued on the admission medicines list,
   now HELD after lactate / AKI review (lactic acidosis risk in acute illness).
   Withhold statin while NBM.
5. VTE assessment, capillary glucose monitoring, repeat lactate and LFTs at 6h.`,

Presenting complaint: central epigastric pain, rigors and jaundice.

HPI: ~5 days of constant midline epigastric pain radiating to the back, worse
after meals. Treated as dyspepsia by GP (omeprazole) with no benefit. Overnight:
rigors, dark urine, family noticed yellow eyes.

On arrival febrile and tachycardic with rigors witnessed in triage. Visibly
jaundiced. Abdomen soft — tenderness EPIGASTRIC, Murphy's sign NEGATIVE.

Because the pain was epigastric I actively excluded mimics:
- ECG sinus tachycardia, no ischaemia; troponin not raised (not ACS).
- Lipase only mildly raised (92) — against primary pancreatitis.
- LFTs are cholestatic (bili 96, ALP 402, GGT 388); WCC 17.4, CRP 214; VBG
  lactate 2.6.

Impression: biliary sepsis — ACUTE CHOLANGITIS despite an atypical (epigastric)
presentation. Sepsis pathway started promptly: IV fluids, blood + urine cultures
sent, catheterised for hourly urine output, and broad-spectrum antibiotics
(piperacillin/tazobactam) given to meet the one-hour sepsis target. Referred to
General Surgery for admission and urgent ERCP. Medicines reconciliation and
allergy review to follow on the ward.`,

Re: 64F, acute cholangitis, sepsis. Documented penicillin allergy (rash).
Piperacillin/tazobactam was started in ED on the sepsis pathway; now switch given the documented penicillin allergy.

The rash is non-severe (no anaphylaxis / SJS), so cross-reactivity risk with
non-beta-lactam agents is not a concern. Recommendation for biliary sepsis in
penicillin allergy:

- Ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV BD PLUS metronidazole 500 mg IV TDS (empirical Gram-
  negative + anaerobic cover for a biliary source).
- Ensure blood + urine cultures were taken before the switch (confirmed sent in ED).
- Chase cultures; de-escalate on sensitivities. Review at 48 hours. Most likely
  organisms: E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterococcus.`,

I reviewed Mrs Hart regarding ~2 weeks of intermittent central epigastric
discomfort after meals. She is systemically well today: afebrile, not jaundiced,
observations normal. Abdomen soft with mild epigastric tenderness only; no
right-sided, radiating or severe pain, and no vomiting.

With no alarm features today, the picture is most consistent with dyspepsia. I
have started a trial of omeprazole 20 mg once daily and arranged review in 4
weeks. Bloods were not indicated at this visit given the absence of red flags.

Safety-netting given clearly and documented: seek urgent / same-day care if she
develops fever, jaundice, dark urine, vomiting, or pain that becomes severe or
persistent.

Kind regards,
Dr R. Shah`,
