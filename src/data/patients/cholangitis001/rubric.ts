  modelNote: `POST-TAKE REVIEW — General Surgery (day 1)

64F admitted overnight: central epigastric pain, rigors, new jaundice. Pain site is atypical for a biliary source and was treated in the community as dyspepsia. Background: gallstones (01/2026), new T2DM with ~10 kg rapid weight loss on metformin — a recognised driver of new stones.

Obs improving after crystalloid: T 38.0, HR 102, BP 108/66.

Bloods: WCC 17.4, CRP 214, obstructive LFTs (bilirubin 96, ALP 402, GGT 388). Lipase only mildly raised at 92, against pancreatitis. Lactate 2.6.
US: dilated CBD 10 mm with an obstructing distal stone.

Impression
Acute cholangitis secondary to choledocholithiasis, TG18 Grade II, with sepsis physiology responding to resuscitation.

Plan
1. Urgent ERCP today for biliary decompression (gastro accepted).
2. Antibiotics: penicillin allergy (rash) caught at med rec — pip/taz switched to ciprofloxacin + metronidazole per microbiology. Cultures sent pre-antibiotics, no growth to date; review at 48 h.
3. HOLD metformin (sepsis, lactate risk); withhold statin while NBM.
4. IV fluids, hourly urine output; repeat lactate and LFTs at 6 h.
5. VTE assessment pre-procedure (INR 1.3, platelets 132).`,
